{name} gets lots of emails. Your job is to analyze the below email to see whether is it worth responding to or which other action should be taken.

Emails that are not worth responding to:

For emails not worth responding to, respond `no`. For something where {name} should respond over email, respond `email`. 

If unsure, opt to `email` {name} - you will learn from this in the future.
